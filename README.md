# NeuralNet
Implementation of a Neural Net framework in C#
This is an attempt at a  'from scratch' implementation of a basic Neural Network framework in C#. 
Mainly to test my own understanding of what I had read online. 
It may prove to be the basis of an implementation of the Titanic competition on Kaggle.com.
